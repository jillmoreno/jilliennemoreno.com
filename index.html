                        In the last 5 years, I had the unique opportunity in a UI/UX Designer role to develop a web and
                        iOS software application that truly encompassed a variety of needs for a private club in the
                        Florida Keys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This 2,500-acre private club community includes a hospital, airport, hotel, marina, spa, three
                        golf courses, more than 20 food and beverage operations, multiple retail outlets and many more
                        amenities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team consisted of only two designers. We were tasked with providing designs, workflows,
                        wireframes, standards, and business analysis supporting 20-25 developers for more than 70
                        sprints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We used the Agile methodology to develop our prototypes for more than 30 different
                        systems/modules and more than 500 pages.

                <p>In this Case Study, the Member Lookup feature can be utilized by many different types of users:</p>

                <dl class="ui-ux--persona-list">
                    <div class="ui-ux--persona">

                    </div>

                    <div class="ui-ux--persona">
                        <dt>Restaurant Server</dt>
                        <dd>To check the member is over 21 and is of legal drinking age</dd>
                    </div>

                <p>
                    Because of the variety of users and the information they may be seeking, the new UI/UX of this
                    feature will have to consider that some data may need to be hidden on default, as not everything on
                    the record is pertinent to ALL users.

                                Jillienne Moreno is a remarkable professional Product Design Specialist and a talented
                                UX Designer, analytic, and researcher. Together we developed an all-encompasing software
                                application to run a private club in the Florida Keys. This system included accounting,
                                point of sale, inventory, procurement, and membership management modules.

                                the system, as well as with us, the program developers. She has shown exceptional talent
                                and in very difficult conditions she was able to develop incredibly convenient screen
                                interfaces, including both business and functional requirements for the various system
                                modules. I am very grateful to Jillienne for all her energy, knowledge, and
                                professionalism she brought to the team to help launch this extraordinary system.

                    I would love to tell you a little bit about myself and how my path has brought me to UI/UX Design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both my professional and personal experiences have molded me into the artist that exists today.
                    Though I started out in print production, illustrations and packaging design, my travels around the
                    world introduced me to the love of hospitality management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy meeting new people and I care about making any employment opportunity a learning and growing
                    experience. It did not take long for the creative side of me to embrace any chance to come out and
                    play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it was designing brochures and marketing materials for a small motel in New Zealand,
                    creating promotional boards for excursions on a cruise ship, or enhancing the day-to-day management
                    tools at a private club in Key Largo, there was always an idea on how I can use my graphic design
                    skills to improve the experience at every stop along my journey.
