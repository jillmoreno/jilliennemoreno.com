                        In the last 5 years, I had the unique opportunity in a UI/UX Designer role to develop a web and
                        iOS software application that truly encompassed a variety of needs for a private club in the
                        Florida Keys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This 2,500-acre private club community includes a hospital, airport, hotel, marina, spa, three
                        golf courses, more than 20 food and beverage operations, multiple retail outlets and many more
                        amenities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team consisted of only two designers. We were tasked with providing designs, workflows,
                        wireframes, standards, and business analysis supporting 20-25 developers for more than 70
                        sprints.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We used the Agile methodology to develop our prototypes for more than 30 different
                        systems/modules and more than 500 pages.

                <h3 class="ui-ux--1">Conducting User Research</h3>

                <p>
                    Afer interviewing users and gathering additional requirements, the following problem statement was
                    created:
                </p>

                <blockquote class="ui-ux--quote">
                    As a User, I need to be able to quickly search for a Member record (or any other type of person
                    record, employee, associate, group, etc) and be able to view a quick summary of that record.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Currently, a very basic Lookup screen is being used that only provides the most basic details of the
                    record:

                <p>Users have requested the following information to be included in their Member Lookup search:</p>

                <ul class="ui-ux--feature-requests">
                    <li>
                        Additional Person Information such as Marital Status, Date of Birth, Desired Prefix/Suffix,

                        Relation to the Primary Account holder, how long have they been members, additional add-on
                        bundles for Golf, Spa, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Basic Contact information for the selected record including Primary Phone, Email, and Mailing
                        address
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to view all other records that are affiliated with the Club Membership, Spouse,
                        Dependents, Employees, etc. and be able to easily navigate those details
                    </li>
                    <li>Detailed Account information including charge privileges and status of the account</li>
                    <li>Easy Navigation from viewing the record details to other areas of the application</li>
                    <li>A Printable version of the record details with clean UI</li>
                    <li>Option to quickly access a member record from their home dashboard</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="ui-ux--2">Creating User Personas - Who is the User?</h3>

                <p>In this Case Study, the Member Lookup feature can be utilized by many different types of users:</p>

                <dl class="ui-ux--persona-list">
                    <div class="ui-ux--persona">
                        <dt>Front Desk Agent</dt>
                        <dd>To find a phone number to contact the member about a reservation</dd>
                    </div>

                    <div class="ui-ux--persona">
                        <dt>Restaurant Server</dt>
                        <dd>To check the member is over 21 and is of legal drinking age</dd>
                    </div>

                    <div class="ui-ux--persona">
                        <dt>Accounting Clerk</dt>
                        <dd>To verify that the account has been suspended due to late payment of fees</dd>

                    <div class="ui-ux--persona">
                        <dt>Membership Agent</dt>
                        <dd>To ensure that a membership type has been added and basic contact info is updated</dd>
                    </div>
                </dl>

                <p>
                    Because of the variety of users and the information they may be seeking, the new UI/UX of this
                    feature will have to consider that some data may need to be hidden on default, as not everything on
                    the record is pertinent to ALL users.

                                Jillienne Moreno is a remarkable professional Product Design Specialist and a talented
                                UX Designer, analytic, and researcher. Together we developed an all-encompasing software
                                application to run a private club in the Florida Keys. This system included accounting,
                                point of sale, inventory, procurement, and membership management modules.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jillienne was responsible for most of the communication with immediate future users of
                                the system, as well as with us, the program developers. She has shown exceptional talent
                                and in very difficult conditions she was able to develop incredibly convenient screen
                                interfaces, including both business and functional requirements for the various system
                                modules. I am very grateful to Jillienne for all her energy, knowledge, and
                                professionalism she brought to the team to help launch this extraordinary system.

                <p>
                    I would love to tell you a little bit about myself and how my path has brought me to UI/UX Design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both my professional and personal experiences have molded me into the artist that exists today. Though I started out in print production, illustrations and packaging design, my travels around the world introduced me to the love of hospitality management. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy meeting new people and I care about making any employment opportunity a learning and growing experience. It did not take long for the creative side of me to embrace any chance to come out and play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it was designing brochures and marketing materials for a small motel in New Zealand, creating promotional boards for excursions on a cruise ship, or enhancing the day-to-day management tools at a private club in Key Largo, there was always an idea on how I can use my graphic design skills to improve the experience at every stop along my journey.
